## CQI traces

The results in the paper are based on traces from PBE-CC[1] and LTEScope, which can be potentially be made available at the discretion of the authors of those traces.

The open-sourced CQI traces are randomly generated, which aims to show the functionality of the codebase. The evaluation results may not represent the performance of the real system.
